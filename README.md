My project is about a Book Store Management.
Developed as the final project of CS50 course by Harvard University
I gives access in 2 ways
1) Admin
2) Customers

Customers can register or login using their credentials and add the books to cart
NOTE: Payment integration is yet to be implemented

The Admins, shop owner has access to different portal with access to add categories
The admins can add the books into the portal and delete the previous books as well
Elastic search is also implemented
Provision to add E-book is also implemented
